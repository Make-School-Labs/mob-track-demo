# Mobile track demo - Boogie Bot Playground 🤖

With this activity you will explore Xcode Playgrounds.

Xcode Playgrounds is a tool used to quickly write code and experiment with it. It's also a great way to learn programming for iOS using the language Swift.

Download this repo and open the file `BoogieBot-short.playground` to get started. It will open with Xcode and you should see the first page introducing you to the activity.

It might take a while to load the first time, but if at any point the Playground becomes unresponsive, try quitting Xcode and opening it again. 😬

Have fun! 🙌🏼

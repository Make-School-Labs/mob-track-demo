## Wrapup
 
 In this playground, you‚Äôve learned about the concept of an API, a set of functions provided by another developer to help you work. Once you‚Äôve learned the basics of programming, you‚Äôll learn a lot more about about working with APIs.
 
 You also practiced using and defining functions, and using functions to group repeated work together.
 
 Dance routines are all about performing a preplanned sequence of moves in repeating patterns, so functions made up of functions (made up of functions, and so on‚Ä¶) are perfect for making great dances.
 
 At the end, you signed your work and made some fun GIFs to share. Want to start a thread to share your dance moves on our slack channel? üï∫üèª
 
 The next page is a blank BoogieBot, so you can create a  new routine and a GIF without overwriting your work. Now‚Äôs your chance to do some interesting things with groups of functions. Give it a try.

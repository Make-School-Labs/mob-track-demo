## Live Views
 
 Live views are a playground feature that let you see instant updates to your work. Live views also allow you to play with animation.
 
 This playground has some special behind-the-scenes features to give it BoogieBot capabilities. These are located in a Sources folder, but today you won't be working there.
 
 Before you get started, make sure your playground is set up to work with live views. The following line of code sets up BoogieBot and makes it dance:
 */
runBoogieBotDemoMode()

/*:
 The live view shows up in the **live view** on the right. ðŸ‘‰
 
 If you donâ€™t see anything there, choose Editor > Live View. The editor area should now be divided in two, with the live view appearing on the right.

 You should see BoogieBot doing some moves in the live view.
 
 On the next page, youâ€™ll make BoogieBot dance to your tune.
